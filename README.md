# Competitive Store Sales Analyzer (CSSA)

## Project Summary
Competitive Store Sales Analyzer (CSSA) is developed to analyze sales using store, promotion, and competitor data. The analysis is based on various key points of a store depending on the nature of the store, such as Sales, Store Type, School Holiday, Assortment, Promo Interval, etc.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Machine Learning**
- **EDA & Data Cleaning** (Data Science)

## Responsibilities
- Utilized libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and sklearn to analyze store data.
- Processed EDA and data cleaning, applying aggregate functions to modify and visualize data using plots and graphs.
- Split data into training and testing sets, applied models on the training data, and predicted accuracy.
- Achieved a highest accuracy of 93% using the XGBoost model and a lowest accuracy of 47% using the KNeighborsRegressor model.
